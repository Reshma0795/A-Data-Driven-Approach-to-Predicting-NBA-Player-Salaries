# Determing-factors-for-high-salary-of-NBA-Players
In this project, I am going to explain the high salary of NBA players. 
  * What factors determine their high salaries and how much should a team pay for a new player given the player's record?
  

I have divided the project into 3 parts - 
## Part A : Web Scraping
In part A, I have scraped data from www.basketballreference.com where I grab information of all NBA players who were active during the 2009/2010 season to the 2020/21 season. Assuming the "most current season" as the 2020/2021 season as the data may not be complete for recent seasons. 

## Part B : Data Preparation and Description
In this second part, I load the data in Python and describe and explore the data.

## Part C : Data Analytics
In this section, I perform data analytics techniques on the prepared data set, and justify and interpret the model.
