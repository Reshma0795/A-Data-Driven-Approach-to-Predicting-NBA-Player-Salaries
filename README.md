# Introduction
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is one of the most famous sports franchises in the world. As of today, this professional basketball league is composed of 30 teams in North America, with more than 500 players playing each year. As of 2020, NBA players are the world’s best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.

# Objective
This project will explore how to use each NBA player’s performance to determine the player’s annual salary.

# Methodology
I have worked on the project in 3 parts.

## Part A : Web Scraping
In part A, I have scraped data from www.basketballreference.com where I grab information of all NBA players who were active during the 2009/2010 season to the 2020/21 season. Assuming the "most current season" as the 2020/2021 season as the data may not be complete for recent seasons. 

## Part B : Data Preparation and Description
In this second part, I load the data in Python and describe and explore the data.

## Part C : Data Analytics
In this section, I perform data analytics techniques on the prepared data set, and justify and interpret the model.
